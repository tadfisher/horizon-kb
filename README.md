# Keyboard parts for Horizon EDA

Various parts I use for developing keyboard projects in [Horizon EDA](https://horizon-eda.org/).

The goal is to get these merged into the [main pool](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon-pool)
eventually.

## Using

After cloning this repo, add it to your pools in Preferences. Open it in the Pool Manager and make
sure it includes the main Horizon pool if it doesn't already.

## License

CC-BY-SA 4.0, same as the main Horizon pool.

See [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md).
